## Projects dashboard

Let's start by creating a new project in Stack AI dashboard. Click on the "New Project" button in the top right corner of the dashboard.

<br/>
<div className="flex justify-center" > <img src="/doc-assets/project-dashboard-view.png" alt="Projects dashboard" width="700" height="700" /> </div>
<br/>
<strong> <h3 className="text-center">Projects dashboard view</h3> </strong>
<br/>

Then, you will see a modal with a long list of templates. For example, you can choose the "Chat with PDF" template to
build an application where your users can chat with PDFs you have uploaded.

<br/>
<div className="flex justify-center" > <img src="/doc-assets/templates-list-view.png" alt="Templates list view" width="700" height="700" /> </div>
<br/>
<strong> <h3 className="text-center">Templates view</h3> </strong>
<br/>

You can search by specific application you would like to integrate with a Large Language Model,
or you can choose the **'Blank'** template to start from scratch.
You will find as well a list of typical use cases on the left side of the modal.

## Builder view

Once you create a project, you will see an interface with 3 main components:

<br/>
<div className="flex justify-center" > <img src="/doc-assets/builder-view.png" alt="Builder view" width="700" height="700" /> </div>
<br/>
<strong> <h3 className="text-center">Builder view</h3> </strong>
<br/>

-   **Canvas:** the main component of the Stack AI tool, a 2D canvas where you can drag and drop nodes and connect them to build your workflow.
-   **Nodes:** a large variety of nodes are available at the left hand side. These nodes represent the components in the flow where data is received, processed, and returned.
-   **Control bar:** a set of commands at the top right hand side with buttons to **'Save'** (save the current version), **'Run'** (execute the workflow as it is in the canvas), **'Share'** (share the current version with another Stack AI user), and **'Publish'** (make your workflow available externally).
